    The <em>ErraiBus</em> framework provides a standardized mechanism using asyncronous messaging (AJAX)
    within GWT applications.
</p>

<p>
    This package contains all of the necessary APIs to use the framework.
</p>

<p>
    ErraiBus uses the CommandMessage/ConversationMessage paradigm for all communication across the bus. The programming
    model is essentially PubSub (publish/subscribe) at it's core. But one of the distinct aspects of ErraiBus is that
    the
    model is consistent on both the server and the client.
</p>

<p><em>An Example Server-side Service</em>:</p>

<p>
    <tt><pre>
    &#64Service
    public class HelloWorld implements MessageCallback {
        public void callback(CommandMessage message) {
            System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
</pre>
    </tt>
</p>
<p>
    The above example service shows a very simple server-side service. The <tt>@Service</tt> annotation is used by the
    framework for auto-discovery of the service. By default, unless otherwise specified, the service will take on the
    name of the class it is annotating, in this case: <tt>HelloWorld</tt>.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Example client-side code, demonstrating use of HelloWorld service</em>:
</p>

<p>
    <tt><pre>
    public class HelloWorld implements EntryPoint {
        /**
         * Get an instance of the MessageBus
         */
        private MessageBus bus = ErraiBus.get();

        public void onModuleLoad() {
            Button clickMe = new Button("Click Me!");

            /**
             * Register a click handler for the button.
             */
            clickMe.addClickHandler(new ClickHandler() {
                public void onClick(ClickEvent event) {
                    /**
                     * Send a message to the 'HelloWorld' service.
                     */
                    CommandMessage.create()
                            .toSubject("HelloWorld")
                            .sendNowWith(bus);
               }
            });

            /**
             * Just add the button to the RootPanel in the DOM.
             */
            RootPanel.get().add(clickMe);
        }
    }
</pre>
    </tt>
