This is the JPA and data synchronization subproject of the Errai web framework.

The goal of this project is to provide a useful subset of JPA 2.0 on the client,
and to provide facilities to easily synchronize dataset updates both ways between
the server and its clients.

Another goal of this project is to provide a standalone JavaScript library for
client-side data persistence and data synchronization to the server via RESTful
communication principles.
