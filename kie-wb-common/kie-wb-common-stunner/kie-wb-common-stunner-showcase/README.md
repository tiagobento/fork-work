Stunner Showcase
================

Execution and demonstration of the various Stunner-based components can be achieved using the following provided Showcase modules. There are currently two showcases available, the [Stunner Project Showcase](./kie-wb-common-stunner-showcase-project) & the [Stunner Standalone Showcase](./kie-wb-common-stunner-showcase-standalone).

  - **Stunner Standalone Showcase** focuses on presenting basic UberFire (Appformer)/Errai components, such as Process Designer, skipping over the more involved & resource-intensive integration of KIE Workbench/Library and Guvnor project components.

  - **Stunner Project Showcase** is built atop the KIE Workbench, Commons, Guvnor and Library components. This more complex showcase demonstrates integration with different KIE Workbench assets and editors. However, for day-to-day development, it is strongly suggested that the Standalone Showcase be utilized over this more complex showcase when working with Stunner components.
